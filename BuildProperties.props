This project housrs MSBuild properties used by the solution.
They've been consolidated into this file for your convenience.

The following properties modify certain behaviors in the build
process, such as changing where the compiled binaries wil be
outputted to.

To tailor these properties to your local machine, refer to your
IDE's documentation on how to set MSBuild global properties for
the project, or manually set the properties using the /p:XXX
MSBuild flag when you build the project via CLI.

DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE TO SUIT YOUR ENVIRONMENT. You may end up
commiting your changes to this file, leading to git churning.

        to. This intentionally deosn't specify a version matrix, such as

        versus "1.4"
        
        The former would require maintaining a "LoadFolders.xml" file,
        while the latter will leave the load resolution up to the game.
        ToolkitCore currently prefers the latter for legacy reasons.
